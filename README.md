# Spring 7: Programmatic Bean Registration

to check:
- the beans should be detected: gutters, Spring view, Structure view
- the beans should be shown in Debugger
- injection (autowiring beans; qualifiers)
- correct names (explicit/implicit)
- conditions (annotations, if-else)
- scopes
- registration: `@Import` single, `@Import` multiple, custom annotation. Check not registered, suggest to register
- registration of registrars
- registration of factories?
- registration in loops?
